# json2html_demo
json2html demo. The demo website for json2html is down so I made a flask app that uses this library. I was using the demo site to make sure data I was receiving from website scrapping was properly formatted by simply pasting my results into the demo site and viewing results.

I do not own the source code behind json2html. Documentation for this library can be found here https://pypi.org/project/json2html/
I simply created a simple web application that utilized this library to convert JSON to a html formatted table on the fly
